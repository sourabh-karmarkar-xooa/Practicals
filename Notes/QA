											QUALITY ASSURANCE ( QA )

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> Some important terms

- Defect
- Test Case
- Quality
- Quality Assurance (QA)
- Quality Control (QC)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> Types of testing

	1) Functional Types

	- Unit testing
	- Component testing
	- Integration testing
	- Functional testing
	- System testing
	- Smoke / Sanity Testing
	- UAT ( User Acceptance Testing)
		- Alpha Testing
		- Beta Testing
	( All the above areas which are automated, except UNIT TESTING is called Automation Testing )

	2) Non-functional Types

	- Performance testing
		- Load testing
		- Stress testing
		- Volume testing
	- Endurance testing
	- Usability testing
	- Scalability testing
	- Configuration testing
	- Compatible testing
	- Security testing

	3) Maintainance Types

	- Regression testing
	- Maintainance testing

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> Widely used tools

- Jira
- Jmeter
- LoadRunner
- Cucumber

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> Testing Techniques

- Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
- Equivalence Partition (EP)
- Decision Table Testing (Cause-Effect Graphing)
- State Transition Technique (Truth Table)
- Error Guessing Technique

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> Defects

- A mistake in coding is caled Error.
- Error found by tester is called Defect.
- Defect accepted by development teeam then it is called Bug.
- Build does not meet the requirements then it is Failure.

---> Severity vs Priority

	1) Severity - Seriousness of defect with respect to functionality.

		a) Critical - Defect affects critical functionality or critical data. It does not have a workaround.
		b) Major - Defect affects major functionality or major data. It has workaround but it not obvious and is difficult.
		c) Minor - Defect affects minor functionality or non-critical data. It as an easy workaround.
		d) Trivial - Defect does not affect functionality or data. It does not even need a workaround. It does not impact productivity or efficiency.

	2) Priority - Importance of defect with respect to customer.

		a) Urgent
		b) High
		c) Medium
		d) Low

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> Test Plan Outline

- Purpose
- Features to be tested
- Features not to be tested
- Approach
- Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements.
- Environmental Needs
- Schedule
- Acceptance Criteria
- Roles and Responsibilities

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> Test Strategy

	- Test Strategy is a high level document which defines the approach for software testing.

	Test Strategy contains :

		- Scope and Objective
		- Business Issues
		- Testing Approach
		- Test Deliverables
		- Defect Tracking Approach
		- Training
		- Automation
		- Risks

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> Traceability Matrix

It is used to trace the requirements to the tests that are needed to verify whether the requirements are fulfilled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---> Automation

Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimum human assistance.

---> Steps of Automation Process

- Test tool selection
- Define scope of Automation
- Planning, Design and Development
- Test Execution
- Maintainence

---> Automation Tool : Cucumber ( https://cucumber.io/ )
